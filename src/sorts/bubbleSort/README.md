# Bubble Sort

The bubble sort algorithm steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are out of order. It repeats the pass through the list until no swaps are needed and the list is sorted.

Smaller values "bubble" up to the top of the list while larger, "heavier" numbers "sink" to the bottom.

The worst-case and average complexity is O(n^2).
